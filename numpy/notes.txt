A library that allows you to create multidimentional arrays (1D, 2D, 3D, 4D ...)

Main differences between NunPy and Lists:
- NunPy is faster because it uses _Fixed Types_ for each array
- Faster to read less bytes of memory
- No type checking when iterating through objects
- NunPy analysis *Contiguous Memory* (the blocks of information of the list are necessarely in sequence, next to each other)
